# Kanrab Wiki

## Goals

MAYBE: include the word educational content
FIX: This is really bad prose. I'm just splurging thoughts without refining them

Kanrab Wiki was created to teach and interconnect topics. 

It's nearly impossible to explain complex topics in a single article and be entirely self-contained.
This results in articles either skipping explanations leaving the reader confused, or briefly 
covering the prerequisites. The latter option is usally what is done and when that occurs, you are 
given poor foundational knowledge and it takes away from article.

With Kanrab Wiki, nothing is assumed. Articles explain that topic in a pedagogical way, and if an 
additional topic is needed to explain the topic, a link to that article is given. Thus, you can
provide a fully in-depth explanation without distracting digressions.

Take for example the explanation of logarithms. Logarithms cannot be taught without the discussion
of exponentiation. Now, an article of logarithms can be created without the reintroduction of
exponents. We need only link back and build on what was build on what was taught in the exponent
article.

A secondary goal is for articles to be as atomic as possible. That is, when teaching a certain,
do not explain other topics. Instead, link to them. However, due to the very nature of creating
educational conent, some overlap is inevitable. A discussion of similar topics that utililize
topics will touch on simliar things.

## Philosophy

This wiki is guided by a simple philosophy: assume nothing. When
